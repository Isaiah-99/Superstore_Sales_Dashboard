## Introduction

The data suggests a balanced distribution of sales across segments and categories, with notable variations in profitability ratios and significant contrasts in total profitability by country.</p>

- **Calculated Fields: Profi per order, profit ratio. Sales per customer.**
- **Data Modeling: Star Schema (*-*).**

## Data Sourcing

It contains 3 tables:

1. ORDERS with 9,995 rows and 21 Columns.
2. RETURNS with 297 rows and 2 Columns.
3. PEOPLE with 5 rows and 2 columns

I connected the Xls file to my Tableau public after cleaning for visualization; I then joined the Orders and Returns table together because of the OrderID column they have in common.
